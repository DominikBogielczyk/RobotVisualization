# Praca Inżynierska - "Zdalny system sterowania wirtualnym robotem za pomocą aplikacji mobilnej"

C++ app - server:
- visualization of the mobile robot and environment in OpenGL,
- Bluetooth receiver.

Android app - client:
- setting the setpoints,
- camera change,

Python app:
- plotting in real time.

# Description
The purpose of this thesis was to design and implement a remotely controlled
virtual robot. As a platform for the virtual robot, a PC with the Windows
operating system was selected. A mobile application for devices with Android
OS was created. Kinematics and 3d visualization of the virtual robot was created
in C++ and OpenGL. Remote communication between PC and Android has
been implemented in Bluetooth technology. After the implementation of the
entire system was completed, remote communication tests were carried out.
The impact of communication delay on control, transmission range and the
impact of the distance between devices on the delay were investigated.
